# SpaceKitProvider

`SpaceKitProvider` can be used to set behaviors on all Space Kit components. It is completely optional.

## `disableAnimations`

We use framer motion for some of our components. Chromatic cannot automatically disable JavaScript based animations; so we have to disable them in some other way to prevent test flake.

Disable animations in all Space Kit components by wrapping your tree with `<SpaceKitProvider>` with the `disableAnimations` prop set to `true`.

## Props

<Props of={SpaceKitProvider} />
